  modes-caption:
    expected: The expected damage value calculated including critical hit rate, hit rate and stability.
    stability: Displays the maximum and minimum numbers that may be played for damage. The maximum value is the maximum damage when a critical hit occurs, and the minimum value is the damage when there is no critical hit and the stability is the lowest.
    stability-with-graze: Similar to stability, but the minimum value also considers the situation of Graze.

  modes:
    common: Basic formula
    critical: Formula for critical hit
  modes-caption:
    common: Basic damage formula. Suitable for most computing situations.
    critical: The damage formula for a critical hit. It is mainly used to present "Two-Handed" in the calculation formula. The formula only simply shows the damage during a critical hit, and some items are outside the formula.
